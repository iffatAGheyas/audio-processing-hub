    "### 🛠 Exercise: Spectral Feature Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Apply unsupervised learning to group audio recordings by timbre based on their spectral characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gather Data**  \n",
    "   - Place several short audio clips (e.g., 2–5 s) of different instruments—piano, violin, flute, trumpet, drums, etc.—in your `sounds/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract Features**  \n",
    "   For each clip, compute a feature vector of spectral descriptors:\n",
    "   - **Spectral Centroid**  \n",
    "   - **Spectral Bandwidth**  \n",
    "   - **Spectral Roll-off** (e.g., 85 % energy cutoff)  \n",
    "   - **Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio** (use HPSS or `librosa.effects.hpss` and compute energy ratio)  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build a Feature Matrix**  \n",
    "   - Assemble an \\(M\\times4\\) matrix, where \\(M\\) is the number of clips and each column is one of the four features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cluster with K-Means**  \n",
    "   - Use scikit-learn’s `KMeans` to partition the feature matrix into \\(K\\) clusters (choose \\(K\\) equal to the number of instrument types you have).\n",
    "   - Examine the cluster labels and see which instruments are grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualize**  \n",
    "   - Create 2D scatter plots of feature pairs (e.g., centroid vs. bandwidth, roll-off vs. H/N ratio), coloring points by their cluster assignment.\n",
    "   - Optionally, reduce to 2 D with PCA and plot the clusters in PCA space.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpret**  \n",
    "   - Do the clusters make sense perceptually?  \n",
    "   - Which features were most discriminative?  \n",
    "   - How would you refine your feature set or clustering parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bonus:** Try another clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering) and compare the results!\n"
